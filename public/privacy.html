  <h1>Budgeteer Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>Budgeteer acts as a layer on top of Google Sheets - a way to view and update the data in a spreadsheet more easily. As such, we do not maintain any servers or databases, and do not transmit or store any Personally Identifying Information, except when retrieving the contents of the spreadsheet you specify to your browser. Your Google credentials are not stored or retained by us, and all communication happens directly between your browser and Google's servers.</p>

  <p>We do not use any kind of browser-based tracking, including Google Analytics.</p>

  <p>Given that we do not store your email address, we will not send you any emails.</p>
